In the air of ourselves the men cry,  
On the cold mountain of summer the young ones breathe,  
In the stillness of the soul the trees whisper,  
Before the moment of the soul the young ones rejoice,  
Beneath the surface of death the old ones rejoice,  
Inside the meaning of evening the men cry,  
Under a cloudless sky of summer the men wander,  
Just the thought of Winter the spirits sing,  
In the air of wanting the oceans vanish,  
In the stillness of desire the poets cry,
